# Since we don't have osx test environment, we use travis-ci to test on osx.
# Free-plan of travis-ci offers limited resources, we only test whether iotdb can be packaged on jdk8 and jdk11.

  # For each test, travis-ci limits its output log. So we cannot test some sub-modules like tsfile, iotdb.
  # We only test jdbc to ensure maven commands work correctly on travis-ci.
